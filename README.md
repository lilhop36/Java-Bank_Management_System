# Bank Management System in Java

• Bank is the place where customers feel a sense of safety for their property. In the bank, customers deposit and withdraw their money. Nowadays, managing a bank is a tedious job up to a certain limit. So a bank management system that reduces the work is essential. Also, today’s world is a genuine computer world and is getting faster and faster day-by-day.

• Thus, considering the above necessities, the system for bank management has become necessary which would be useful in managing the bank more efficiently.

## Problem Statement:
• The Bank Management system consists of the bank administrator and the customer. The administrator will need to create a new account for the customer by logging into their existing account. The system executes operations like creating a new account, checking the balance of the account, withdrawing, depositing, money transfers between two accounts, and viewing transaction history.

All the data of the administrator is already stored in the database. If the credentials do not match, the user does not have access to the system.![Login Page][]**Main Menu:**  Through this page the user can add a customer, create an account, deposit, withdraw, transfer, report, balance check, and can add a new admin.![Main Page][]- Addition of new customer and then creating account for the customer.![Add Customer][]![Add Account][]**Transaction Page:**  The user can perform two actions, i.e., withdrawing and depositing on his account. On loading the withdraw/deposit page, the user has to enter the account no. If the account no details are stored in the database, it will be reflected on this page.![Withdraw Page][]**Transfer Page:**  On this page, the user can transfer money from one account to another account. On loading, the user has to enter the account no’s from which he wishes to transfer money.![Transfer Page][]**Report Page:**  It displays all the details of the customer to the administrator.![Report Page][]**Balance Page:**  It displays the account balance of the selected customer.![Balance Page][]**Admin Page:**  It allows the existing administrator to create new administrators and delete existing administrators.![Admin Page][]## System Requirements:• **Interpreters:** Java and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).• **Software:** Netbeans, XAMPP.• **Database:** MySQL.• **Hardware:** 10GB storage, 4GB RAM, 4.1.2## Conclusion:- The bank management system is a virtualization of transactions in the banking system.- The banking system uses manual working but when we use a bank management system it is totally virtual, and this process avoids manual work and converts it into an automatic process.- The bank management system saves time with accuracy compared to the traditional bank system.- It also reduces the human errors caused by employees or the customers themselves.## Documentations:- [Project Ppt](https://github.com/lilhop36/Java-Bank_Management_System/blob/main/Extras/Reports/PPT_SEITA_19.pptx)- [Final Report](https://github.com/lilhop36/Java-Bank_Management_System/blob/main/Extras/Reports/ProjectReport_SEITA_19.pdf)## References:- [javatpoint - Online Banking Project](https://www.javatpoint.com/online-banking-project)- [ProjectsGeek - Complete Banking System Java Project](https://projectsgeek.com/2016/02/complete-banking-system-java-project.html)- [Apache Friends - XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
